## Parallel Computation using MPI

During my masters course I completed the below two assignments as a course project for CSV 880: Special Module in Parallel Computation.

### Assignment 1
> Averaging based computations on a matrix using block-cyclic distribution. 

- Goal is to write an MPI program to perform the template (averaging) based computations on a matrix `A` specified as follows:

	The program will read a matrix `A` of size `m x n` comprising of floating point numbers from inpFile. The program should run on `p x q` ranks logically arranged as a 2-D grid. The matrix should be distributed on the ranks in a block-cyclic distribution with block size `s x s`. The program will perform `l` iterations:

### Assignment 2
> Broadcasting on a 2D Torus using a single spanning tree. 

- It performs a broadcast of a 2D Torus using a single spanning tree. The code reports the total packets received by every node and the maximum congestion on any link. In initial version of the code, each node receives 1 packet and congestion=1. Goal was to modify the code to perform the broadcast using 4 non-contending spanning trees. Each node should receive 4 packets, and congestion should remain 1.
